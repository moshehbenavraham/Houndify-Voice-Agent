# Codebase Audit and Repair Summary

## 🚨 Critical Security Issues Fixed

1. **Removed Hardcoded API Credentials**
   - ✅ Removed API keys from `src/server/config/houndify-config.js`
   - ✅ Removed client ID from `public/js/main.js`
   - ✅ Updated `README.md` to remove exposed credentials
   - ✅ Added environment variable validation with helpful error messages

2. **Created Security Infrastructure**
   - ✅ Created `.gitignore` to prevent credential exposure
   - ✅ Created `.env.example` with placeholder values
   - ✅ Added `/api/config` endpoint to serve client ID securely

3. **Fixed CORS Configuration**
   - ✅ Implemented configurable CORS origins via `CORS_ORIGINS` environment variable
   - ✅ Added proper CORS error handling

## 🛠️ Development Environment Improvements

1. **Package.json Updates**
   - ✅ Added missing `dotenv` to dependencies
   - ✅ Added comprehensive devDependencies (nodemon, eslint, prettier, jest, supertest)
   - ✅ Added scripts for linting, formatting, and testing
   - ✅ Added `prestart` script to validate environment configuration
   - ✅ Added Node.js engine requirements

2. **Development Configuration Files**
   - ✅ Created `.eslintrc.json` with Airbnb configuration
   - ✅ Created `.prettierrc` for consistent code formatting
   - ✅ Created `jest.config.js` for testing setup
   - ✅ Created `.prettierignore` to exclude generated files

3. **Testing Infrastructure**
   - ✅ Created `tests/` directory with setup file
   - ✅ Added sample test file demonstrating endpoint testing

## 🔧 Code Quality Improvements

1. **Server Enhancements**
   - ✅ Added request logging middleware
   - ✅ Improved error handling with appropriate status codes
   - ✅ Added 404 handler for unknown endpoints
   - ✅ Added startup warnings for missing credentials
   - ✅ Added environment-aware error messages

2. **Client-Side Updates**
   - ✅ Removed hardcoded client ID
   - ✅ Added configuration loading from server
   - ✅ Added configuration validation before API calls
   - ✅ Improved error handling for missing configuration

## 🧹 Cleanup

- ✅ Removed unused `src/client/` directory structure
- ✅ Updated CLAUDE.md with new commands and security practices

## 📝 Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions Required:**
   - Create a `.env` file based on `.env.example`
   - Add your Houndify credentials to the `.env` file
   - If credentials were already exposed, regenerate them on Houndify dashboard
   - Run `npm install` to install all new dependencies

2. **Development Workflow:**
   ```bash
   # First time setup
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env with your credentials
   npm install
   
   # Development
   npm run dev
   
   # Before committing
   npm run lint:fix
   npm run format
   npm test
   ```

3. **Recommended Future Improvements:**
   - Add comprehensive test coverage
   - Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
   - Add input validation for all endpoints
   - Consider updating Houndify SDK version (currently using 3.1.13)
   - Add TypeScript support for better type safety
   - Implement proper logging solution (Winston, Bunyan, etc.)
   - Add API documentation (Swagger/OpenAPI)

## ⚠️ Important Security Note

If the exposed API credentials were real and have been committed to any public repository, they are permanently compromised. You must:
1. Immediately regenerate new credentials on the Houndify dashboard
2. Update your `.env` file with the new credentials
3. Never commit the `.env` file to version control
